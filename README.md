# n-body-lambert-solver
This repository gives a possible algorithm to solve [Lambert Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_problem), 
but in a N-body context, implementing a boundary value problem solver throught [shooting method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_method).

## Get started

The main files are [main.m](./main.m) and [shootingMethod.m](./shootingMethod.m). You can start specting them. I give some instructions along the script, 
but if you just want to quick check, you can just run [shootingMethod.m](./shootingMethod.m).
